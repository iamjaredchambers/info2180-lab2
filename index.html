  <main> <h2> Authority in the Church</h2>
  <h2> (September 14, 2021 By Scott Mcknight)</h2>
    
    <article>First, I want to push against this term “authority.” This term is never used in the NT for pastors, bishops/overseers, or elders. Not once. They do not have authority, God does, Jesus does, the Spirit does. Which isn’t to say there isn’t some dimension of power and authority in the pastoral leader but I do want to register hesitation on framing the question with that term. By framing it with “pastoral authority” the discussion gets rigged in the wrong direction. <img src ="Bible" alt = "The Word of God" />

    In fact, what authority a pastor or priest has is reshaped by the kind of authority Christ manifested, which was cruciformity or what I like to call Christoformity (see Pastor Paul). Read about this in the wonderful narrative in Mark 10:35-45. Jesus clearly was against power over and was for power for the sake of others. Which means self-denial and not self-protection or self-affirmation and especially self-aggrandizement. So if the pastor has concerns about loss of authority he or she may actually be facing a fresh alignment with Christ’s own practice.Some may ask about Hebrews 13:17. (“Be persuaded by your leading ones and yield [to them]…”) The NIV unfortunately translates what I have translated “yield” (hupeikō) with “submit to their authority.” The term “leaders” (NIV) or “leading ones” (above; it’s a participle) suggests leading and other following, which is a biblical sense of authority if you want the term, and it is defined here as yielding to them. But the word “authority” is not present in the Greek text and it gives off an air that is not necessarily present in the verbal ideas of this verse.

    So, what authority the pastor has needs to submit itself to the kind of authority Jesus teaches in Mark 10 and that we see in Philippians 2, and we need to make sure it does not smell like Rome’s political power.
    
    Second, let’s give back their term “authority” and use it. I ask immediately, What authority, then, does a pastor, priest, or bishop have? In spite of my hesitations to use that term it is clear that the cleric has some kind of spiritual authority over what his or her job description gives him or her authority. I express this for a broad reach of church configurations: Baptists, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Catholics. What the pastor is called to do is exercise gifts in nurturing Christoformity in his or her assigned church. Which means teaching and preaching and leading and discipling and mentoring and guiding etc.. Each of us has power to influence other people, whether we are parents or teachers or community leaders. The pastor has the same kind of power to influence within the space assigned to her or him. Let’s say then that a pastor has authority over what a pastor is called to do.</article>

     <h2> Beware! This Android Trojan Stole Millions of Dollars from Over 10 Million Users</h2>
    <h2>(September 29, 2021 By Ravie Lakshmanan)</h2>
    <article>A newly discovered "aggressive" mobile campaign has infected north of 10 million users from over 70 countries via seemingly innocuous Android apps that subscribe the individuals to premium services costing €36 (~$42) per month without their knowledge.<img src = "PictureHacking.jpg" alt = "Hacking" width ="400" height ="260"/>

      Zimperium zLabs dubbed the malicious trojan "GriftHorse." The money-making scheme is believed to have been under active development starting from November 2020, with victims reported across Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. 
      
      No fewer than 200 trojan applications were used in the campaign, making it one of the most widespread scams to have been uncovered in 2021. What's more, the malicious apps catered to a varied set of categories ranging from Tools and Entertainment to Personalization, Lifestyle, and Dating, effectively widening the scale of the attacks. One of the apps, Handy Translator Pro, amassed as much as 500,000 downloads."While typical premium service scams take advantage of phishing techniques, this specific global scam has hidden behind malicious Android applications acting as Trojans, allowing it to take advantage of user interactions for increased spread and infection," Zimperium researchers Aazim Yaswant and Nipun Gupta said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

      "These malicious Android applications appear harmless when looking at the store description and requested permissions, but this false sense of confidence changes when users get charged month over month for the premium service they get subscribed to without their knowledge and consent."Like other banking trojans, GriftHorse does not exploit flaws in the Android operating system, but rather socially engineers users into subscribing their phone numbers to premium SMS services upon downloading the apps.

      Following a successful infection, the victims are bombarded with deceptive alerts promising a free "GIFT" that, when clicked, redirect them to a geo-specific webpage to submit their phone numbers for verification. "But in reality, they are submitting their phone number to a premium SMS service that would start charging their phone bill over €30 per month," the researchers said.
      
      In building a stable cash flow of illicit funds, the GriftHorse campaign not only managed to fly under the radar and avoid antivirus detection, but also has generated millions in recurring revenue each month, potentially surpassing hundreds of millions in the total amount plundered from these victims, the researchers noted.
      
      Following responsible disclosure to Google, the apps have been purged from the Play Store. But they continue to be available on untrusted third-party app repositories, once again underscoring the risks associated with sideloading arbitrary applications and how they can emerge as an intrusion route for malware.
      
      "Overall, GriftHorse Android Trojan takes advantage of small screens, local trust, and misinformation to trick users into downloading and installing these Android Trojans, as well frustration or curiosity when accepting the fake free prize spammed into their notification screens," Yaswant and Gupta concluded.
